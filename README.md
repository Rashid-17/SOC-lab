# Windows Security Monitoring and Incident Investigation using Splunk

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Security Operations Center (SOC) lab using **Splunk Enterprise**, **Splunk Universal Forwarder**, and a **Windows Virtual Machine**.

The objective of this project is to centralize Windows Security Event Logs, monitor authentication activities, and investigate security-related events using Splunk Enterprise as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform.

Windows Security Event Logs are forwarded to Splunk Enterprise using Splunk Universal Forwarder and analyzed using Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL). This project provides hands-on experience in log collection, security monitoring, authentication analysis, and basic incident investigation.

# Splunk Searches Performed

## 1. View All Indexed Events

```spl
index=main
```

**Output**

---

## 2. Windows Security Logs

```spl
index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
```

**Output**

---

## 3. Count Events by Sourcetype

```spl
index=main
| stats count by sourcetype
```

**Output**

---

## 4. Successful Login Events (Event ID 4624)

```spl
index=main EventCode=4624
```

**Output**

![Successful Login Events](screenshots/04_eventcode_4624.png)

---

## 5. Failed Login Events (Event ID 4625)

```spl
index=main EventCode=4625
```

**Output**

![Failed Login Events](screenshots/05_eventcode_4625.png)

---

## 6. Failed Login Count by User

```spl
index=main EventCode=4625
| stats count by Account_Name
```

**Output**

---

## 7. Failed Login Investigation

```spl
index=main EventCode=4625
| table _time host Account_Name Source_Network_Address
```

**Output**

## 8. User Account Created (Event ID 4720)

```spl
index=main EventCode=4720
```

**Output**
